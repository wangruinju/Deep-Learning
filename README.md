I have also reviewed two amazing courses offered by Stanford University, which are 

* [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html)

* [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

For the basic of machine learning, please refer to Andrew's [Maching Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) and [CS229: Maching Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/). Here is [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/wangruinju/Machine-Learning-Coursera) for Andrew's Machine Learning course as guidance if needed.
